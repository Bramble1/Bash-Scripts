This is a personal bash script to efficiently bookmark/open common websites via terminal.

# Improvements completed. Can now enter a string of numbers to open multiple bookmarks at the same time

#usage
./bookmark.sh         -run with no arguments to print the help screen and how to use


#misc

I've added an alias to my .bashrc so i can just access the script and it's bookmarks.txt record from anywhere.
